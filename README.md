# niftiManip
These are scripts that help you manipulate nifti and other files that compress dicoms. Not all are well documented at the moment, but many are. These scripts will particularly help translate coordinates between all sorts of various spaces. writeROI in particular should work well and can do some thresholding, binarizing, and basic arithmetic on nifti files (and then write them out as the name implies).
